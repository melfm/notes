# Bayesian Classifier
In theory we would like to predict qualitative response using the Bayes classifier. But for real data, we don't know the conditional distribution of Y given X and so computing the Bayes classifier is impossible. The Bayes classifier serves as an unattainable gold standard against which to compare other methods.
