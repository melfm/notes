# Single-Layer Perceptron
The perceptron is the simplest form of a neural netwrok used for classification of patterns said to be $linearly separable$ meaning that the patterns that lie on the opposite side of a hyperplane. It consists of one neuron with adjustable synaptic weights and bias. The perceptron built around built around a single neuron is limited to performing pattern classification with only two classes. By expanding the output (computation) layer of the perceptron to include more than one neuron, we may correspondingly form classification with more than two classes.
