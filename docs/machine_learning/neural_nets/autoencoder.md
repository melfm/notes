## Autoencoder
### Representation Learning
- To process of discovering not only the mapping from representation to output but also the representation itself.
- The quitessential example of a representation learning algorithm is the autoencoder.
- An autoencoder is the combination of an encoder function that converts the input data into a different representation
- A decoder function converts the new representation back into the original format
- Autoencoders are trained to preserve as much information as possible, but also trained to make the new representation
have various nice properties


## Semantic Hashing

- Using a deep autoencoder as a hash-function for finding *approximate* matches.
- Fast retrieval methods typically work by interesting stored lists that are associated with cues extracted from the query.
- Computers have special hardware(memory bus) that can intersect 32 very long lists in one instruction.
	- Each bit in a 32-bit binary code specifies a list of half the addresses in the memory
- Semantic hashing uses machine learning to map the retrieval problem onto the type of list intersection the computer is good at.
