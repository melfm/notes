# Deep Learning

* Aims to solve the problem of learning representation by introducing representations
that are expressed in terms of other simple representations.
These networks learn complex concepts out of simpler concepts.
* An alternative way to think about this :
    * Each layer of representation is considered the state of computer's memory after executing
another set of intrusctions in parallel. Sequential instructions offer power because later
instructions can refer back to the results of earlier instructions.
    * The term deep can be regarded as the models that either involve a greater amount of composition of
learned functions or learned concepts that traditional machine learning does.

Note: Modern deep learning draws inspiration from many fields such as linear algebra, probability,
information theory and numerical optimization.
