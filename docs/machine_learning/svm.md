# SVM

* Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models that assign
new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.
* In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can perform a non-linear classification using the $\textbf{kernel trick}$, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

## Definition
- A SVM constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space
- This can be used for classification, regression or outlier detection
- Intuitively a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training data of any class
