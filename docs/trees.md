# Classification and Regression Trees
## Decision trees
Set of splitting rules used to segment the predictor space and summarized in a tree. Tree-based methods are simple and useful for interpretatin.

### Prediction via Stratification of the Feature Space
1. Divide the predictor space - that is, the set of possible values for $X_1, X_2,...,X_p$ into $J$ distinct and non-overlapping regions $R_1, R_2,...,R_J$.
